**ClientServeJS** is a lightweight client-side file serving library designed to deliver complete web applications directly from the browserâ€”no backend or hosting server required. It supports service workers, Blob URLs, and offers compatibility with ZIP and CSJ archive formats.

Ideal for distributing single-page apps, Unity WebGL builds, and offline-capable PWAs.
